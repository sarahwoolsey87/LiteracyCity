# LiteracyCity

User Story:
As an owner of an educational consultancy business specializing in literacy, I want to have a website that promotes my services and provides valuable resources for parents and educators. The website should include an "About Us" page to showcase our expertise and background. It should also have a dedicated section to list the services we offer, allowing visitors to understand the range of support we provide.

To further assist parents and educators, I would like to include a "Useful Links" page where they can find additional resources and references related to literacy. This page should offer a curated collection of reliable and informative websites, articles, and tools.

Additionally, I want to engage users and provide an interactive experience by incorporating a terminology quiz. This quiz will test users' knowledge of literacy-related terms and provide them with immediate feedback on their performance.

Recognizing the importance of gamification, I aim to include a "Games" section where users can access fun and educational literacy games. Initially, at least one functional game will be available, providing an entertaining way for users to reinforce their literacy skills. The website should also be designed to easily accommodate the addition of more games in the future.

Overall, the website will serve as a comprehensive platform that showcases our expertise in literacy, offers valuable resources, engages users through quizzes and games, and creates a user-friendly experience for both parents and educators.
